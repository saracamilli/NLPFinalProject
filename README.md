# Sara Camilli and Palmer Robins
# NLP Final Project

# We used a corpus from Metrolyrics (380,000 lyrics) for this project. The CSV file "lyrics.csv" is included in this package and will be automatically accessed when run. In order to run this classifier on a different set of lyrics, the name of the CSV file must be modified in the "Parser.py" file. This new file must be able to be parsed by Python's built-in CSV reader in order for this classifier to work properly.

# Currently, this classifier is able to distinguish country and hip-hop songs. Future iterations of this classifer will ideally be able to distinguish more genres.
